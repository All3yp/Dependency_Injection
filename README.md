# Dependency Injection in Swift


Implementing dependency injection in a basic project, using the model layer to manage and manipulate objects


Dependency Injection is often used with the intention of writing code that is loosely coupled, and thus, easier to test. When we use dependency injection in our code, we are essentially giving an object its instance variables. What this means is that instead of giving our object the responsibility of creating itâ€™s own dependencies, we inject the dependencies to the object instead.
